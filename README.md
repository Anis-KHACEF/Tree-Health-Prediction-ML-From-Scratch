# Tree Health Prediction - ML From Scratch

This repository contains my end-to-end Machine Learning pipeline to predict the health status of trees based on environmental data. 

Rather than relying solely on high-level APIs, I focused on implementing fundamental algorithms from scratch to deeply understand the underlying mathematics and optimization.
